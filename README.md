# A Simple Genetic Algorithm

<p>This program is a simple implementation of a genetic algorithm found at <br> http://www.ai-junkie.com/ga/intro/gat1.html.</p> When fed an integer number, the program will teach itself how to build a simple math formula that sums to that number.


## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/WillFarris/GeneticAlgorithm.git
cd GeneticAlgorithm
make
```

## Usage

```
./gene <target>
```

<p> Or, if no arguments are supplied, the program will prompt you for one.</p>
